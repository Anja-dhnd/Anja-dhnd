### Hi there, I'm Ania ðŸ‘‹ 
#### I'm a junior developer from Brussels. Besides coding, I'm highly interested in cybersecurity and blockchain technology. Check out my first and temporary [portfolio](https://anja-dhnd.github.io/portfolio/) (ps. I look mean but I promise I'm sweet.)

ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently working on improving my knowledge of Python and started a cybersecurity bootcamp.


ðŸ”­ Long-term goals:
- Contribute to an open-source project.
- Brute force my way into cybersecurity. (in progress)

âš¡ Fun fact: 
I used to study linguistics and translation and love to learn new languages. 
I already speak a couple of them but now, I took a break and decided to switch to programming languages. :information_desk_person:
