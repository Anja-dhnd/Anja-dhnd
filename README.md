### Hi there, I'm Ania 👋 
#### I'm a junior web developer in Brussels aiming at becoming a full-stack developer. 
#### Besides coding, I'm highly interested in cybersecurity and blockchain technology. 

🌱 I’m currently working on improving my knowledge of PHP and on building my own website/blog. 
After that, I'd like to learn: 
- Laravel
- Vue.JS
- Python

🔭 Long-term goals:
- Contribute to an open-source project
- Get into cybersecurity

⚡ Fun fact: 
I used to study linguistics and translation and love to learn new languages. 
I already speak 5 of them but now, I took a break and decided to switch to programming languages. :information_desk_person:
