### Hi there, I'm Ania 👋 
#### I'm a junior web developer from Brussels aiming at becoming a full-stack developer. Besides coding, I'm highly interested in cybersecurity and blockchain technology. Check out my first and temporary [portfolio](https://anja-dhnd.github.io/portfolio/) (ps. I look mean but I promise I'm sweet.)

🌱 I’m currently learning Drupal and am working on improving my knowledge of PHP and Python. 


🔭 Long-term goals:
- Contribute to an open-source project.
- Brute force my way into cybersecurity.

⚡ Fun fact: 
I used to study linguistics and translation and love to learn new languages. 
I already speak 5 of them but now, I took a break and decided to switch to programming languages. :information_desk_person:
